plan:
  . add another ScrollMode 
    . that uses the difference in time as the scroll speed (or the inv of it)
      . the current one needs constant fast + needs speed buildup
  . maybe shortcut to switch scroll modes?
  . seperate into files
  . try contributing to rdev for better grab features on linux
  . add .toml config file
  . look for a better way to block keys if not rdev
